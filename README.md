# Simple Artificial Neural Network (ANN) Implementation

This repository demonstrates a simple implementation of an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) using Python. The workflow includes feature engineering, feature selection, train-test splitting, neural network creation (with input, hidden, and output layers), early stopping, plotting, making predictions, and evaluating results with a confusion matrix and accuracy score.

## Overview

The project provides an end-to-end example of training a neural network for a classification problem. The steps include:

1. **Feature Engineering:** Transforming raw data into features suitable for modeling.
2. **Feature Selection:** Selecting the most relevant features for training.
3. **Train-Test Split:** Dividing the data into training and test sets.
4. **Neural Network Creation:** Building the ANN with input, hidden, and output layers.
5. **Early Stopping:** Using early stopping to prevent overfitting.
6. **Plotting:** Visualizing the training and validation loss.
7. **Predictions:** Making predictions on the test set.
8. **Confusion Matrix & Accuracy:** Evaluating the model's performance.

## Workflow Steps

1. **Feature Engineering**
    - Clean and preprocess the data.
    - Generate new features if necessary (e.g., scaling, encoding).

2. **Feature Selection**
    - Select important features using statistical methods or domain knowledge.

3. **Train-Test Split**
    - Use `train_test_split` from scikit-learn to split data.

4. **ANN Creation**
    - Use Keras/TensorFlow or PyTorch to build the neural network.
    - Add input, hidden, and output layers.

5. **Early Stopping**
    - Implement early stopping to monitor validation loss and avoid overfitting.

6. **Plotting**
    - Plot training and validation loss curves.

7. **Making Predictions**
    - Use the trained model to make predictions on the test set.

8. **Confusion Matrix and Accuracy**
    - Use scikit-learn to compute the confusion matrix and accuracy score.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- numpy
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- tensorflow or keras (for ANN)

Install dependencies using:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib tensorflow
```

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository.
2. Ensure requirements are installed.
3. Run the main script (e.g., `python ann_example.py`).
4. Check the output graphs and evaluation metrics.

## Results

- **Loss Curves:** The training and validation loss curves are plotted to visualize learning progress and detect overfitting.
- **Confusion Matrix:** A confusion matrix shows the number of correct and incorrect predictions.
- **Accuracy Score:** The overall accuracy of the model on the test set is displayed.
